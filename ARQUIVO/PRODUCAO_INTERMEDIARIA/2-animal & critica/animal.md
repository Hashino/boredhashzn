# Lyrics
```
I'm an animal, inside of your skin
It feels like dying when you look at the edge

It feels like jumping in is the solution
To the problems we made in the way

I'm an animal, inside of your skin
It feels like I'm dying not next to my kin

I miss your kisses in the night alone
This cold feels like a dye to the bone

It feels like falling apart all again
Like what we did didn't give any gain

I'm an animal, inside of *your* skin
Please let me in, so we can end the begin

Some of those legends we told weren't there
But we still fought alone together true and through

I'm like an animal, when I'm not singing for you
This is the only place, I can comfortably, see all of your cues

TODO: banda, warn us, we didn't have a cue
```
